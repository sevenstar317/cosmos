		how your personality will assert itself, and what modes of activity will stimulate your physical
		energies.
		Aries people tend to be energetic, forceful and outgoing. They are good at getting things done,
		although they prefer starting to finishing. Like the energy of the first rush of spring, they move
		into the world in a headstrong, pioneering way. Aries people are likely to rush into things before
		reflecting, and may also be impatient or unwilling to sit back and allow events to mature. They
		have great vitality and a tremendous need to be physically active.
		Aries people have a strong will, and are self-centered about pursuing it, so that they may try to
		dominate other people until they learn to be more subtle about getting their way. They also have
		an acute need for love and affection. Aries people benefit from self-discipline, so that they can
		channel their abundant energy more constructively.

		and is associated with aesthetics, beauty, refinement and romance. Its position in the chart
		indicates the area in which the give and take of love, affection and sensual pleasure will be

		Taureans revel in the pleasures of life. They crave the security and comfort of relaxing in the
		warmth of their home environment. They value the senses and the enjoyment of material things.
		Taureans are likely to work hard to make their home an attractive one. They also have the
		makings of a healer and have a large capacity for kindness.
		Although they are quiet on the surface, almost passive, Taureans possess a powerful will and
		can be quite stubborn at times, and perhaps somewhat rigid in their thinking. Taureans also tend
		to be loving, obedient and loyal. Material rewards seem to come easily to them, and they are
		able to lead the good life without being excessively concerned about it. Taureans are practical,
		and provide a purposeful, productive and stabilizing influence for themselves and all those

		Gemini is the sign associated with communication, logical thought processes (based on duality)
		and the conscious mind. Gemini people tend to be airy and intellectual, glib of tongue and
		curious about life and other people. They can experience two sides of things at the same time,
		and may tend to be flighty.
		Geminis move through life like a butterflies, engaging in many varied experiences to gain
		knowledge. They are witty and have a good sense of humor, and are likely to be excellent

		Cancer

		Cancer Period: June 21 - July 22
		Cancer Mode: Cardinal
		Cancer Element: Water
		Ruling Planet of Cancer: The Moon
		House Ruled by Cancer: Fourth
		Cancer Polarity: Negative
		Most Compatible Zodiac Signs: Scorpio, Pisces, Taurus, Virgo
		Least Compatible Zodiac Signs: Aries, Libra, Aquarius, Sagittarius
		Opposite Zodiac Sign: Capricorn

		The ruling planet for Cancer is The Moon.

		The Moon represents the personal self, the feelings and the unconscious. It is a reflection of the
		true self, represented by the Sun. The Moon also stands for security and instinctual or habitual
		patterns, as well as the ability to relate to others, and to be nurturing to others. The Moon rules
		Cancer and is exalted in Taurus. It is often contrasted with the Sun as the female receptive
		principle versus the masculine or positive principle. The Moon represents the feminine and
		nurturing part of oneself. In a male chart, the Moon represents the feminine within, or the anima
		and also indicates the type of partner you will attract. The Moon also represents an attunement
		from the past, which operates at an instinctive or habitual level in your present life.
		Cancerians are nurturing and protective of others. Their ruling planet is the Moon, and they tend
		to be moody, with constantly changing emotions. Cancerians are also likely to be securityconscious
		and highly value their home life. They may appear passive, and tend to rely on their
		feelings to make decisions. They are subtle, rather than direct, and are likely to reflect the
		moods of those around them.
		Cancerians may be involved with the past in some way, because the sign of Cancer, the sign of
		nurturing, protecting and sustaining, is strongly tied to the past, and the principle of Karma. They
		tend to collect the residue of past experience and hold onto it, allowing it to color present
		activities and lead them to instinctual action.
		Rather than allowing themselves to be driven by their changing moods, they benefit from
		shedding the light of conscious reason on their habitual patterns and focusing on their true
		goals.

		Least Compatible Zodiac Signs: Taurus, Scorpio, Pisces, Capricorn
		Opposite Zodiac Sign: Aquarius

		The ruling planet for Leo is The Sun.

		The Sun represents the Self, one's way of being in the world. It can represent, on different
		levels, both the ego and the higher Self or soul purpose. It rules Leo and is exalted in Aries. The
		Sun is the most important 'planet' in the chart and symbolizes one's will and sense of vitality.
		When the Sun is afflicted (poorly placed or poorly aspected) it could indicate problems with the
		father, or male role model. The Sun energizes your entire chart, and planets in close
		relationship to the Sun (by planetary aspect) are emphasized in your personality. If your Sun is
		prominent in your chart, you will exhibit great power to do and to be.
		Leos are likely to express themselves in dramatic, creative and assertive ways. They are also
		likely to enjoy the warmth of the physical Sun. Leos have great energy, courage and honesty.
		They are likely to be self-confident and maybe even a bit self-indulgent as they expect to be the
		center of attention, and often are. Leos can be quite determined and usually get their way when
		they really want to. They also possess great integrity, and are a natural leader.
		Leo people are very proud. Their challenge is to temper any tendency for arrogant or egotistical
		behavior and to instead develop humility and compassion; to learn detachment in the gift of their
		affections, so that they radiate their abundant energy freely and enhance the life experience of
		others around them.

		its exaltation in Aquarius. Mercury is an airy planet, associated with all forms of communication
		and the in-flow and out-flow of intelligence. Its position indicates how your mental function will
		be expressed, and where techniques and skills are available to you.
		Virgo people tend to be very conscious of details. They may appear nervous or obsess over
		health issues. They are likely to be neat and orderly, at least in some area of their life, although
		they may exhibit the opposite tendency in cases where they have not yet found their guiding
		principle of organization.
		Virgos love work, service to others and the gathering of the fruits of the material world, as
		symbolized by the harvest. They are also likely to be a good conversationalist, with wideranging
		knowledge and interesting ideas. They can be analytical and perhaps overly fond of
		detail, with perfectionist tendencies, and they may miss out on the big picture by concentrating
		on the micro. It also benefits them to learn the fine line between discrimination and criticism.
		Virgos' mission in life is the purification of their activity in pursuit of their goals, manifesting their
		inherent love of excellence in all strivings.

		expressed.
		Libra is the sign of harmony and relationship. The Sun in Libra is at the time of the Equinox,
		when day equals night, and similarly Libra strives for balance between polarities.
		Librans are known for their good taste, elegance and charm. They are seekers of harmony and
		beauty. Their natural mode of living is in partnership with others. Intimate relationships are quite
		important to them, as are issues of social justice. Libras forever hope that all parties in a conflict
		will be satisfied, and they have a tendency to understand and support both sides of a dispute,
		which can drive their friends crazy unless they are smart enough to value the mediation that
		Libras naturally provide. Libras will go out of thier way to avoid a quarrel, and they may have a
		hard time making a decision.
		Artistic pursuits of all kinds provide an outlet for Libras' love of beauty. They benefit from
		strengthening their will to act in favor of their higher purpose, which ultimately lies in dedicating
		themselves to humanity at large.

		evolution.
		Scorpio is the most intense sign of the Zodiac, and is associated with sexual activity and with

		Scorpios have great personal magnetism and great powers of persuasion or even the ability to
		coerce others. Their will is strong, and they let nothing stand in their way of achieving their
		goals. They may suffer in life, but their pain leads to important personal transformation. They are
		very good at group dynamics, and working with the public.
		Scorpios are a shrewd judge of other people's motives, and may be willing to use their special
		knowledge to their own advantage. Although they can be manipulative at times, when they work
		out their issues to be more in line with their own higher nature, they can take on the charismatic
		power of a natural healer, transforming themselves and society around them.

		responsibility. They also tend to be conscious of social mores, perhaps to the point of overconcern.
		Their natural caution allows them to advance slowly and steadily to the top. Capricorn
		represents the accomplishments of the material and the quest for prestige, honor and success
		in public achievement. It is also possible that the driving force behind their ambition partially lies
		in deep-rooted feelings of insecurity.
		Capricorns put themselves under enormous pressure to perform, and can feel personally
		responsible for those around them. They may have suffered from a restrictive early
		environment, and their aloofness may serve to protect them from dealing with a fear of intimacy,
		or low self-esteem. Capricorns exemplify the values of hard work and accomplishment, and
		service to the goals of humanity. Their redemption comes when they allow the spiritual joy that
		they feel inside to fully express itself in graceful acts of loving-kindness.
